# Storybook Component Improvement Initiative

## Session Overview

This document summarizes a focused development session on the `storybook` branch aimed at improving the quality, accessibility, and maintainability of React components in the Momentum project's component library.

## Purpose and Context

The initiative focused on systematically improving existing components to meet modern accessibility standards, enhance code quality, and improve maintainability. This work was part of preparing the component library for broader use across the application.

## Key Improvements Made

### Accessibility Enhancements
- Added proper `type` attributes to button elements across components
- Implemented ARIA attributes for better screen reader support
- Enhanced semantic HTML structure for improved accessibility compliance

### Code Quality Improvements
- Replaced array index keys with stable, meaningful keys in map operations
- Refactored conditional props using spread operator syntax for cleaner, more readable code
- Improved component prop handling and type safety

### CSS Organization and Maintainability
- Reorganized CSS rules in component stylesheets for better logical grouping
- Enhanced CSS class structure for improved maintainability
- Added new CSS rules to support enhanced component functionality

### Component-Specific Enhancements
- **Alert Component**: Improved prop handling and accessibility
- **Card Component**: Better CSS organization and conditional prop management
- **DataSourceCard Component**: Enhanced prop structure and accessibility
- **DateRangeSelector Component**: Code quality improvements
- **Sidebar Component**: Minor accessibility enhancements
- **TeamMember Component**: Improved key handling and prop management
- **Toggle Component**: Significant enhancements for proper form integration with new CSS support

### Storybook Story Updates
- Fixed story naming consistency (Error → ErrorAlert)
- Updated story configurations to reflect component improvements
- Enhanced story examples for better documentation

## Files Affected

The following 11 files were modified during this session:

**Storybook Stories:**

## Next Steps

The work completed in this session positioned the codebase for:

1. **Pull Request Creation**: Changes were committed and ready for PR creation against the main branch
2. **Code Review**: All improvements follow established patterns and best practices
3. **Documentation Updates**: Component improvements are reflected in updated Storybook stories
4. **Quality Assurance**: Changes maintain backward compatibility while improving code quality

## Impact

This initiative enhances the overall quality of the component library by:
- Improving accessibility for all users
