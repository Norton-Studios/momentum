# Project Progress

## Current Status: Authentication & Multi-Tenancy Complete

The project has successfully implemented comprehensive tenant management and authentication. The foundational monorepo structure is solid, and the plugin-based architecture is working effectively. The system now supports secure multi-tenant operations with a single-database approach.

## What Works

-   **Core Repository Structure:** The monorepo is set up with Yarn workspaces, with working `api`, `frontend`, and `crons` applications, plus the `plugins` directory structure.
-   **Database Schema Synthesis:** The mechanism for combining modular Prisma schemas from plugins into a single, unified schema is implemented and working.
-   **Tenant Management (COMPLETE):** Full tenant resource plugin with User, Tenant, and TenantDataSourceConfig models.
-   **Authentication System (COMPLETE):** Basic Auth middleware with bcrypt password hashing, API token support, and tenant context isolation.
-   **Tenant Creation (COMPLETE):** Secure POST /tenant endpoint with system admin token protection and automatic admin user creation.
-   **GitHub Data Source:** The `github` data source plugin is implemented and can fetch repository data from the GitHub API.
-   **Repository Resource:** The `repository` resource plugin is implemented with an API to expose the collected data.
-   **Team Resource:** The `team` resource plugin is implemented with comprehensive API endpoints.
-   **Commit Resource:** The `commit` resource plugin is implemented with relationships to repositories and contributors.
-   **Contributor Resource:** The `contributor` resource plugin is implemented with team and repository relationships.
-   **Memory Bank:** Comprehensive documentation system is maintained and up-to-date.

## What's Left to Build

1.  **Tenant Data Isolation:** Add tenant_id filtering to existing resource plugins (Team, Repository, Commit, Contributor).
2.  **Cron Job Runner:** Implement the cron job runner in `apps/crons` to execute the data source plugins with tenant context.
3.  **Frontend Authentication:** Build login/logout UI and tenant-aware components.
4.  **Reporting Engine:** Implement the initial version of the reporting engine with tenant isolation.
5.  **More Data Sources:** Extend GitHub integration and add other sources (GitLab, Jenkins, JIRA).
6.  **Security Enhancements:** Add rate limiting, audit logging, and password reset functionality.

## Known Issues

-   Existing resource plugins (Team, Repository, etc.) don't yet filter by tenant_id - needs to be implemented for full data isolation.
-   Frontend needs to be updated to work with the new authentication system.

## Recent Architectural Decisions

-   **Single Database Multi-Tenancy:** Moved from multi-database to single-database approach with tenant_id filtering for simpler management and deployment.
-   **Basic Auth:** Chose Basic Auth over JWT for simplicity while maintaining security with bcrypt password hashing.
-   **Plugin-Based Tenant Management:** Tenant functionality implemented as a resource plugin following established patterns.
