# Project Progress

## Current Status: Initialization

The project is in its initial phase. The foundational monorepo structure, core application shells, and essential documentation are in place. The Memory Bank has just been initialized to serve as the single source of truth for all future development.

## What Works

-   **Core Repository Structure:** The monorepo is set up with Yarn workspaces, containing placeholders for the `api`, `frontend`, and `crons` applications, as well as the `plugins` directory.
-   **Database Schema Synthesis:** The mechanism for combining modular Prisma schemas from plugins into a single, unified schema is implemented.
-   **GitHub Data Source:** The `github` data source plugin is implemented and can fetch repository data from the GitHub API.
-   **Repository Resource:** The `repository` resource plugin is implemented with an API to expose the collected data.
-   **Memory Bank:** The core documentation files for the Memory Bank have been created and updated.

## What's Left to Build

1.  **User & Tenant Management:** Implement the authentication and multi-tenancy logic in the API.
2.  **Cron Job Runner:** Implement the cron job runner in `apps/crons` to execute the data source plugins.
3.  **Frontend Scaffolding:** Build out the basic UI components for displaying data.
4.  **Reporting Engine:** Implement the initial version of the reporting engine.
5.  **More Plugins:** Continue to build out more data source and resource plugins.

## Known Issues

-   None at this stage.
