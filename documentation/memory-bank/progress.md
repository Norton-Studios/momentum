# Project Progress

## Current Status: Initialization

The project is in its initial phase. The foundational monorepo structure, core application shells, and essential documentation are in place. The Memory Bank has just been initialized to serve as the single source of truth for all future development.

## What Works

-   **Core Repository Structure:** The monorepo is set up with npm workspaces, containing placeholders for the `api`, `frontend`, and `crons` applications, as well as the `plugins` directory.
-   **Database Schema Synthesis:** The mechanism for combining modular Prisma schemas from plugins into a single, unified schema is implemented.
-   **Dynamic Module Loading (Conceptual):** The core applications are designed to support dynamic loading of plugins, but no plugins have been fully implemented yet.
-   **Memory Bank:** The core documentation files for the Memory Bank have been created.

## What's Left to Build

Everything. The immediate next steps will involve building out the core functionalities:

1.  **User & Tenant Management:** Implement the authentication and multi-tenancy logic in the API.
2.  **First Resource Plugin:** Create the first fully functional resource plugin (e.g., `team` or `repository`).
3.  **First Data Source Plugin:** Create a data source plugin (e.g., for GitHub) to start collecting data.
4.  **Frontend Scaffolding:** Build out the basic UI components for displaying data.
5.  **Reporting Engine:** Implement the initial version of the reporting engine.

## Known Issues

-   None at this stage.
