# Active Context

## Current Focus

Multi-tenancy and authentication system has been successfully implemented. The current focus has shifted to documentation updates and ensuring all components work with the new single-database multi-tenancy approach.

## Recent Changes

-   **Implemented Tenant Management & Authentication (COMPLETED):**
    -   Created comprehensive tenant resource plugin at `plugins/resources/tenant/`
    -   Implemented User, Tenant, and TenantDataSourceConfig models
    -   Built authentication middleware using Basic Auth with bcrypt password hashing
    -   Created POST /tenant endpoint for tenant creation with system admin token security
    -   Moved from multi-database to single-database tenancy approach
-   **Updated Architecture:**
    -   Removed multi-database complexity in favor of tenant_id-based data isolation
    -   Simplified tenant creation (no longer creates separate databases)
    -   Updated documentation to reflect single-database multi-tenancy
-   **Documentation Updates:**
    -   Updated PROGRESS.md to mark tenant management as completed
    -   Updated ARCHITECTURE.md and PROJECT_GOALS.md for single-database approach
    -   Updated multi-tenancy prompt documentation

## Next Steps

1.  **E2E Testing Infrastructure:** Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing system with testcontainers, programmatic migrations, and full service orchestration
2.  **Tenant Data Isolation:** Add tenant_id filtering to existing resource plugins (Team, Repository, etc.)
3.  **Frontend Authentication:** Build login/logout UI and tenant-aware components
4.  **Continue Plugin Development:** Develop more data source and resource plugins with tenant context
5.  **Security Enhancements:** Add rate limiting and audit logging to the authentication system
