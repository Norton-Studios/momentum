# Active Context

## Current Focus

The primary focus is the initial setup and population of the Memory Bank. This involves creating the core documentation files that define the project's goals, architecture, and technical landscape.

## Recent Changes

-   Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` to establish the project's mission and objectives.
-   Created `memory-bank/productContext.md` to detail the problem statement and user experience goals.
-   Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to document the high-level architectural decisions.
-   Created `memory-bank/techContext.md` to outline the technology stack and development practices.
-   Added `documentation/adr/005-switch-to-yarn.md` to document the decision to switch from npm to Yarn.
-   Updated `memory-bank/techContext.md` to reflect the change in package manager to Yarn.

## Next Steps

1.  Create the `memory-bank/progress.md` file to capture the current state of the project.
2.  Begin work on the foundational features of the platform, starting with the core application setup.
