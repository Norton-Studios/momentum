# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Engineering leaders and teams often lack a unified, data-driven view of their development lifecycle. Key metrics are scattered across various tools (e.g., Git, CI/CD, project management), making it difficult to identify bottlenecks, measure performance, and make informed decisions. This platform aims to solve that by aggregating and analyzing development data in one place.

## Target Audience

-   **Engineering Managers & VPs:** Who need high-level dashboards and reports to track team performance, project health, and ROI.
-   **Team Leads & Developers:** Who can use the data to understand their own workflows, identify areas for improvement, and celebrate successes.
-   **Platform Administrators (Self-Hosted):** Who are responsible for deploying and managing the tool within their organization.

## How It Works

The platform operates on a simple, powerful loop:

1.  **Collect:** It connects to various data sources (like GitHub, Jenkins, Jira) via plugins to collect raw development data.
2.  **Process:** It standardizes and enriches this data, creating a unified model of resources like commits, pull requests, and deployments.
3.  **Analyze & Report:** It runs analyses on the processed data and generates insightful reports, which can be delivered through various channels (email, webhooks, etc.).

## User Experience Goals

-   **Modular and Unobtrusive:** Users should be able to add or remove data sources and reports easily, without disrupting their existing workflows.
-   **Insightful, Not Prescriptive:** The platform should surface data and trends, empowering teams to make their own decisions rather than enforcing a specific methodology.
-   **Automated and Reliable:** Data collection and reporting should be a "set it and forget it" process that runs reliably in the background.
