# Project Brief: Developer Productivity Platform

## Mission

To create a highly extensible, data-driven platform that provides insights into the software development lifecycle. The system is designed for both multi-tenant SaaS and self-hosted deployments, with a core focus on modularity and AI-assisted development.

## Core Objectives

1.  **Extensible by Design:** Build a plugin-based architecture where new data sources, resources, and reports can be added independently and with minimal friction.
2.  **Flexible Deployment:** Support both multi-client SaaS and single-instance, self-hosted deployment models with clear data isolation.
3.  **AI-Centric:** Structure the codebase, documentation, and development processes to be easily understood and managed by AI agents.
4.  **Data-Driven Insights:** Implement a powerful reporting engine to process collected data and deliver actionable insights.
5.  **Reliable Data Collection:** Ensure all data collection processes are idempotent, reliable, and resumable to maintain data integrity.
6.  **Seamless Onboarding:** Provide a smooth and automated onboarding experience for new clients in the SaaS environment.
