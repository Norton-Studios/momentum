# Phase 5: Reporting Engine

This phase focuses on generating and delivering insights from the collected data.

**Task 5.1: Design and Implement the Report Queue and Delivery System**
*   **Goal:** Create a system to manage and send reports.
*   **Prompt for AI Agent:**
    > "Create a `ReportQueue` table with Prisma. Build a core cron job that checks this queue. For each pending report, it should execute the corresponding report script. Implement a modular delivery system. Start with an 'email' delivery module using a library like Nodemailer. The system should be extensible to support other methods like SFTP."

**Task 5.2: Create a Sample Report**
*   **Goal:** Build the first end-to-end report.
*   **Prompt for AI Agent:**
    > "Create a new report at `reports/repository-summary`.
    > - `cron/`: A script that queries the `Repository` table, generates a simple summary (e.g., total count, new repositories this week), and adds it to the `ReportQueue` table for email delivery.
    > - `frontend/`: A simple React component that displays the latest repository summary report."
