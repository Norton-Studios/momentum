# SonarQube Configuration Setup for Momentum Monorepo

## Overview
This document summarizes the setup of SonarQube configuration for the Momentum project, a modular web application for measuring developer productivity. The configuration was designed to work with the project's monorepo structure using Yarn workspaces.

## Configuration Details

### 1. SonarQube Project Properties
Created a `sonar-project.properties` file at the root of the monorepo with the following key configurations:

- **Project Identification**: 
  - Key: `norton-studios.momentum`
  - Name: `Norton Studios :: Momentum`
  - Version: `1.0.0`

- **Source Configuration**:
  - TypeScript source directories across all workspaces
  - Exclusions for build artifacts, node_modules, test files, and generated code
  - Test file patterns for `.test.ts`, `.spec.ts`, and e2e test directories

- **Code Coverage**:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript LCOV report paths from all workspaces
  - Coverage exclusions for test files and configuration files

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow
Implemented a CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/sonarqube.yml`) with:

- **Triggers**: 
  - Push events to master branch
  - Pull request events

- **Workflow Steps**:
  1. Repository checkout with full git history
  2. Node.js 20 setup
  3. Yarn dependencies installation
  4. Test execution with coverage generation
  5. SonarQube scan using official GitHub Action

- **Security**: 
  - SonarQube token stored as GitHub secret (`SONAR_TOKEN`)
  - Host URL configuration for SonarQube server

### 3. Monorepo Structure Considerations
The configuration accounts for the project's structure:
- Multiple application workspaces (api, frontend, crons, database)
- Plugin-based architecture (resources, data-sources, reports)
- E2E tests in a separate workspace
- Shared configuration and generated files

## Benefits
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Analyzes all TypeScript code across the monorepo
2. **Quality Gates**: Automated checks on every push and pull request
3. **Technical Debt Tracking**: Monitors code quality metrics over time
4. **Security Analysis**: Identifies potential vulnerabilities in the codebase

## Next Steps
- Ensure `SONAR_TOKEN` and `SONAR_HOST_URL` are configured in GitHub repository secrets
- Monitor initial scan results and adjust quality profiles as needed
- Consider adding branch analysis for feature branches
- Set up quality gates based on project requirements
