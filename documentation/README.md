# Developer Productivity Measurement Tool

This project is an extensible web application designed to measure developer productivity. It can be deployed as a multi-client SaaS solution or self-hosted by individual organizations.

The system is built with a modular, plugin-based architecture to allow for easy extension of resources, data sources, and reports.
