# ADR 001: Initial System Architecture

-   **Status:** Accepted
-   **Date:** 2025-06-21
-   **Deciders:** Cline (AI Agent)

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to design a system for measuring developer productivity that is extensible, maintainable, and supports multiple deployment models (SaaS and self-hosted). The development process itself will be heavily reliant on AI agents, so the architecture must be easy for them to understand and work with. The core challenge is to create a structure that allows for the easy addition of new metrics, data sources, and reports without requiring deep changes to the core application.

## Decision Drivers

-   **Extensibility:** The system must be easy to extend with new functionality.
-   **Scalability:** The architecture should handle a growing number of tenants, metrics, and data points.
-   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be easy to understand, test, and refactor.
-   **AI-Friendliness:** The structure should be simple and predictable for AI agents to navigate and modify.
-   **Deployment Flexibility:** The same codebase should support both multi-tenant SaaS and single-tenant self-hosted deployments.

## Considered Options

1.  **Monolithic Architecture:** A single, large application containing all logic. This is simpler to start but becomes difficult to maintain and extend.
2.  **Microservices Architecture:** Splitting every component into its own service. This offers great separation but introduces significant operational complexity, especially for a self-hosted product.
3.  **Monorepo with a Plugin-Based Architecture:** A single repository containing multiple, semi-independent packages. Core packages provide foundational services (API, UI), while "plugin" packages (metrics, data sources) are discovered and loaded at runtime.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** "Monorepo with a Plugin-Based Architecture" was selected.

This approach provides the best balance of the decision drivers:

-   **Extensibility:** New features can be added as self-contained packages, minimizing impact on the core system.
-   **Scalability:** The core systems can be scaled independently, and the database design supports multi-tenancy.
-   **Maintainability:** Code is organized into logical domains (packages), making it easier to manage. Using npm workspaces simplifies dependency management.
-   **AI-Friendliness:** The clear, modular structure is easy for an AI to reason about. An agent can be tasked with creating a new "metric" and will have a clear template to follow.
-   **Deployment Flexibility:** The same monorepo can be built and deployed in different configurations to suit the target environment.

## Consequences

### Positive

-   Development of new features is decoupled from the core application.
-   Clear separation of concerns between modules.
-   Simplified dependency management across the entire project.

### Negative

-   Initial setup is more complex than a monolith.
-   Requires a robust dynamic discovery mechanism for the plugins.
-   Build tooling can be more complex to manage across multiple packages.
