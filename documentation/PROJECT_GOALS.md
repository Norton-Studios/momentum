# Project Goals

1.  **Extensible Platform:** Create a highly modular, plugin-based system where new data sources (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub), metrics (e.g., pipeline runs, code churn), and reports can be added with minimal effort.

2.  **Flexible Deployment:** The application must support two primary deployment models:
    *   A multi-client SaaS platform with data isolation between tenants.
    *   A self-hosted option for individual organizations.

3.  **AI-Centric Development:** The project structure and documentation should be optimized for development assisted by AI agents. This includes clear, atomic tasks, comprehensive documentation, and a well-defined rule set for agents.

4.  **Data-Driven Insights:** Provide a robust reporting engine that can process collected data and deliver insights through various channels (e.g., email, SFTP).

5.  **Idempotent & Reliable Data Collection:** Data collection processes must be reliable, resumable, and idempotent, ensuring that running the same collection process multiple times does not produce duplicate data.

6.  **User-Friendly Onboarding:** For the SaaS version, provide a smooth onboarding experience for new clients, including dynamic database provisioning and initial configuration of teams and repositories.
